# Agentic AI Development Workflow

## Working with AI Agents

### Context Management
- Always provide clear, specific requirements
- Reference existing code patterns and conventions
- Use file paths and line numbers when discussing specific code

### Task Breakdown
- Break large features into small, testable units
- Create clear acceptance criteria
- Maintain traceability from vision to implementation

### Code Review Process
- AI agents should follow existing code patterns
- Enforce consistent naming conventions
- Validate against specs before implementation

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before implementation
- Use AI to generate test cases from specs
- Validate behavior against acceptance criteria

## Best Practices

### Communication
- Be explicit about requirements
- Provide examples when possible
- Ask for clarification when uncertain

### Code Quality
- Follow existing project conventions
- Maintain consistent architecture
- Document decisions and rationale
