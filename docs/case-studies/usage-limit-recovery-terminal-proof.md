# Terminal Proof: Usage Limit Recovery in Action

*Actual terminal output from January 23, 2025*

## The Setup: Implementing Usage Limit Recovery

```
> something to consider quick, does the limit usage affect the assistant? 
> what I mean is does a new assistant onboard when I comeback later, should we
> monitor this in addition to the autocompact?

⏺ Great question! Yes, you're absolutely right to think about this...
```

Assistant recognizes the need and starts implementation.

## The Implementation (Lines 79-257)

```
⏺ Let me start by documenting the differences and then add monitoring capabilities:

⏺ Write(file_path: garden/docs/features/session-continuity-comprehensive.md)…
⎿ Wrote 116 lines to garden/docs/features/session-continuity-comprehensive.md

⏺ Update(garden/apps/sprout-cli/main.go)…
⎿ Added prepareColdHandoff() function
⎿ Added --prepare-cold-handoff command
⎿ Added --include-usage-context flag
```

## Testing Our Own Feature (Lines 268-271)

```
⏺ Let's test the new cold handoff preparation:

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/nutmeg/sprouted/garden && ./apps/sprout-cli/build/sprout weather --prepare-cold-handoff)…
⎿ 🔄 Preparing for Cold Handoff (Usage Limit Interruption)
✅ Current state preserved
📋 Session Summary for Next Assistant:
🎯 Current Focus: documentation (85% confidence)
```

## The Moment of Truth (Lines 393-402)

```
> start the process!

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/nutmeg/sprouted/garden && ./apps/sprout-cli/build/sprout weather --prepare-cold-handoff)…
⎿ 🔄 Preparing for Cold Handoff (Usage Limit Interruption)
...
💡 Tip: Usage limits reset daily/monthly depending on your plan
⎿ Claude Max usage limit reached. Your limit will reset at 7pm.
```

**THE FEATURE WE JUST BUILT RAN RIGHT BEFORE WE NEEDED IT!**

## The Recovery (Lines 413-426)

```
> hello, what can you tell me about what we were working on, my usage limit hit 
> before we were able to help onboard you, this may be a great opportunity to
> analyze what happened when we lost contact abruptly!

⏺ Hello! Perfect timing for testing our new usage limit recovery system! Let me analyze what happened and get back up to speed.

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/nutmeg/sprouted/garden && ./apps/sprout-cli/build/sprout weather --onboard-ai --include-usage-context)…
⎿ 🆕 NEW ASSISTANT COLD START - Full Onboarding Context:
(Previous session ended due to usage limits)
{
  "usage_limit_context": {
    "session_type": "cold_start_after_usage_limit",
    "interruption_reason": "User hit Claude usage limits (daily/monthly)",
    "continuity_notes": "This is a completely new assistant. Previous assistant lost all memory."
  }
}
```

## The Analysis (Lines 427-462)

New assistant immediately understands:
- ✅ This was a usage limit interruption (not context limit)
- ✅ Previous work: "Just completed: Usage limit monitoring and handoff system (the very feature that saved us!)"
- ✅ Zero confusion about state or progress

## The Numbers Don't Lie

- **Line 79**: Started implementing usage limit recovery
- **Line 268**: Tested the feature  
- **Line 399**: Hit actual usage limit
- **Line 420**: New assistant fully onboarded
- **Total recovery time**: Seconds

## The Perfect Quote (Line 464)

```
> that's awesome, How can we capture this and show the effectiveness to the community?
```
