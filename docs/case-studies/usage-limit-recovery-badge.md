## 🎯 Marketing Copy

### Short Version
**Usage Limit Recovery Certified™** - The only development tool validated by accidentally hitting limits during its own development. If it can save itself, it can save you.

### Long Version
On January 23, 2025, we achieved something no developer has ever celebrated: hitting Claude's usage limits. Why? Because the Weather System we were building automatically preserved everything, and our new session picked up flawlessly. Talk about eating your own dog food!

### Social Proof Quote
> "I've never been happier to see an error message. Our usage limit interruption became the perfect validation of the Weather System. It literally saved the session it was being built in!"
> — The Sprouted Team
