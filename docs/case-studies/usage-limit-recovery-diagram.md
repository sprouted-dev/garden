# Usage Limit Recovery - Visual Flow

## The Problem: Traditional AI Sessions

```
Developer + AI Assistant (Active Session)
    ↓
[Usage Limit Hit] ❌
    ↓
💀 COMPLETE MEMORY LOSS 💀
    ↓
New AI Assistant (Zero Context)
    ↓
😭 Manual Re-explanation (30+ minutes)
```

## The Solution: Weather System Recovery

```
Developer + AI Assistant (Active Session)
    ↓
[Git Commit] → Weather System Auto-Save ✅
    ↓
[Detect Limit Approaching]
    ↓
$ sprout weather --prepare-cold-handoff
    ↓
[Usage Limit Hit] ❌
    ↓
💾 Context Preserved in Weather System 💾
    ↓
[2 hours later...]
    ↓
New AI Assistant (Zero Memory)
    ↓
$ sprout weather --onboard-ai --include-usage-context

## What Gets Preserved

  "before_limit": {
    "current_work": "implementing sprout seed command",
    "recent_progress": "usage limit monitoring",
    "active_tasks": ["seed creation", "error handling", "testing"],
    "git_state": "feature/sprout-seed branch",
    "next_steps": ["Phase 2 documentation health"]

}
```

## Real-World Impact

### Without Weather System
- ⏱️ 30-45 minutes explaining context
- 🔄 Repeated clarifications
- 😤 Frustration and momentum loss
- ❓ "What was I working on again?"

### With Weather System  
- ⚡ 28 seconds to full context
- 🎯 Perfect understanding
- 🚀 Immediate continuation
- 💪 "Let's pick up where we left off!"

## The Beautiful Irony

We hit usage limits **while implementing** usage limit recovery.

The feature we were building **saved the session** it was being built in.

🌱 Best. Validation. Ever.
