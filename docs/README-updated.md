## Why Weather Service?

**The Problem**: Developers lose 23% of productivity to context switching. Every break, every new AI conversation, every team handoff destroys valuable context.

**Our Solution**: Automatic, intelligent context preservation that works like weather:
- 🌡️ **Temperature** = Development activity level
- ☀️ **Conditions** = Project health and momentum  
- 📊 **Patterns** = Historical trends and predictions
