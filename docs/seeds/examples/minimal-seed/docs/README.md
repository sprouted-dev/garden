# Minimal Seed Example

This is the absolute minimum structure needed for the Weather System to understand your project.

## How We Work

We keep it simple - just code and minimal docs. We document only what's essential for understanding the codebase.

## Directory Structure

- `docs/` - This directory with just this README
- Code lives in the root directory
- No complex hierarchies

## Key Concepts

- Ship fast
- Document later (if needed)
- Let code speak for itself

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Read this README
3. Start coding

That's it. The Weather System will track your git activity and build context from your commits.
