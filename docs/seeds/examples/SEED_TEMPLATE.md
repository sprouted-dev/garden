# Seed Example Template

All seed examples follow this structure:

```
[seed-name]/
└── docs/
    └── README.md    # How this team works
```

## Minimal Seed
- Just README.md
- Perfect for: Solo projects, experiments
- Growth path: Add docs as needed

## Team Seed  
- README.md + decisions/ + retrospectives/
- Perfect for: Small teams, startups
- Growth path: Add processes as team scales

## Enterprise Seed
- README.md + compliance/ + architecture/ + governance/
- Perfect for: Large organizations
- Growth path: Already comprehensive

## Key Principle

Every seed starts the same way:
1. Create docs/README.md
2. Explain how you work
3. Let structure emerge naturally

The Weather System adapts to whatever patterns develop.
