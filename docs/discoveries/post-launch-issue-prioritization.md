# Architectural Discovery: Post-Launch Issue Prioritization

**Date**: 2025-05-22
**Discovered By**: Architecture review post-launch
**Discovery Type**: Strategic Planning
**Impact Level**: High

## The Discovery

We've already launched! This changes our approach from "what must be fixed before launch" to "what should we prioritize for early adopters and growth."

## Post-Launch Reality Check

### What This Means
1. **Real Users** - People are already using the system
2. **Reputation Risk** - Issues affect trust immediately  
3. **Backward Compatibility** - Changes must not break existing users
4. **Communication Critical** - Must be transparent about known issues

### Immediate Priorities (Week 1-2)

#### ðŸš¨ Security Patches
```markdown
**SECURITY ADVISORY**: Shell Injection Vulnerability
- Affects: Git operations with user input
- Risk: Medium (requires local access)
- Workaround: Avoid special characters in commit messages
- Fix: v0.2.0 (estimated 1 week)
```

#### ðŸªŸ Windows Support
```markdown
**KNOWN ISSUE**: Windows Compatibility
- Status: Git hooks require bash
- Workaround: Use WSL or Git Bash
- Fix: Native PowerShell hooks in v0.3.0
```

#### ðŸ”’ Data Integrity
```markdown
**RELIABILITY**: Concurrent Access
- Risk: Context corruption with multiple terminals
- Workaround: Use one terminal at a time
- Fix: File locking in v0.2.0
```

### Growth Priorities (Week 3-4)

1. **Multi-User Support**
   - Critical for team adoption
   - Design collaborative features
   - Weather Station preview

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Address memory issues
   - Add progress indicators
   - Background processing

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Better error messages
   - Recovery commands
   - Setup validation

### Strategic Opportunities (Month 2+)

1. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Community extensions
   - Custom workflows
   - Integration ecosystem

2. **Weather Station Beta**
   - Early access program
   - Feedback collection
   - Pricing validation

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - Audit trails
   - Access control
   - Compliance tools

## Communication Strategy

### Transparency Approach
```markdown
# Known Issues & Roadmap

We believe in transparency. Here's what we're working on:

## Current Limitations
- Windows: Requires WSL/Git Bash (native support coming)
- Performance: Large repos may be slow (optimization underway)
- Multi-user: Single developer focus (collaboration features planned)

## Security
- No known critical vulnerabilities
- Regular security reviews
- Responsible disclosure: security@sprouted.dev

## Get Involved
- Report issues: github.com/sprouted/garden/issues
- Feature requests: Welcome!
- Contributing: See CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### Community Building
1. **Early Adopter Program**
   - Special recognition
   - Feature input priority
   - Weather Station beta access

2. **Feedback Loops**
   - Weekly office hours
   - Community Discord
   - Public roadmap

3. **Trust Building**
   - Rapid patch releases
   - Clear communication
   - Under-promise, over-deliver

## Technical Debt Management

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Weeks 1-4)
- Security patches
- Critical bug fixes
- Windows compatibility
- Basic monitoring

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Months 2-3)
- Performance optimization
- Multi-user support
- Plugin system design
- Weather Station alpha

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 4-6)
- Database backend option
- Enterprise features
- Advanced analytics
- Global expansion

## Success Metrics

### Week 1
- Zero critical security issues
- <24hr patch response time
- 90% user retention

### Month 1
- Windows support shipped
- 100+ active users
- 5+ community contributions

### Quarter 1
- Weather Station beta launch
- 1000+ active users
- Sustainable growth rate

## The Opportunity

Being already launched with known issues is actually an advantage:
1. **Real feedback** from actual users
2. **Community trust** through transparency
3. **Rapid iteration** based on usage
4. **Natural prioritization** from user pain

## Key Insight

"Launch early, iterate quickly, communicate transparently" beats "perfect but never ships."

Our users know they're early adopters. They expect issues but also expect:
- Rapid fixes
- Clear communication  
- Their feedback to matter
- To be part of something growing
