# Fresh Eyes on AI Hallucination: A Newcomer's Perspective
*Date: May 24, 2025*

## The Advantage of Being New

Having only started using AI in the last couple of weeks, I discovered something that experienced users might overlook: AI doesn't just hallucinate facts - it can hallucinate entire timelines and histories.

## What I Expected vs What I Found

**Expected**: AI might get some facts wrong
**Reality**: AI created an entire fictional project history spanning months for a 3-day-old project

## Why Fresh Eyes Matter

1. **No normalized dysfunction** - I haven't learned to accept this as "just how AI works"
2. **Clear documentation** - I documented what I saw without technical jargon
3. **User empathy** - I experienced what actual users will experience
4. **Problem validation** - If I hit this in 2 weeks, others will too

## The Discovery Process

- Started project: May 21, 2025
- Used AI assistants intensively for development
- AI created documentation with dates from December 2024 and January 2025
- Initially didn't notice (too focused on building)
- May 24: "Wait, these dates don't make sense"
- Investigated and found systematic temporal hallucination

## What This Means for Weather System

This newcomer's discovery validates the entire premise:
- AI context issues aren't just theoretical
- They happen to real users in real projects
- They can be subtle and go unnoticed
- They need systematic solutions, not just workarounds

## The Irony

The Weather System I built to preserve context was documented by AI that lacked temporal context. It's like hiring a translator who doesn't speak the language.

## Lessons for AI Tool Builders

1. **Don't assume users know about hallucination**
2. **Build in reality checks**
3. **Make temporal grounding explicit**
4. **Document the weird stuff**

## Why This Case Study Matters

Most AI case studies are written by experts who've internalized these quirks. This is a real user hitting a real problem in their first two weeks. That's the authentic experience most users will have.
