# Architectural Discovery: Weather Resilience and Backup Architecture

**Date**: 2025-05-22
**Discovered By**: Architecture discussion
**Discovery Type**: Critical Gap
**Impact Level**: Critical

## The Discovery

The Weather System stores invaluable context in local files (.garden/weather-context.json, event stores) with no backup or recovery mechanism. A corruption or accidental deletion would result in catastrophic loss of project intelligence, development history, and accumulated insights.

## Context That Led to Discovery

While reviewing the orchestration implementation, we realized all context preservation happens locally without redundancy. This single point of failure threatens the core value proposition of the Weather System.

## Evidence/Examples

Current vulnerability points:
```
.garden/
├── weather-context.json       # Single file, no backups
├── conversations/             # Irreplaceable AI discussions  
└── event-queue/              # Unprocessed events could be lost

.farm/
├── events/                   # Farm-level events, also vulnerable
├── weather/current.json      # Aggregated intelligence at risk
└── orchestrator.db          # Future event store, needs protection
```

Potential disasters:
- Accidental `rm -rf .garden/`
- Git clean operations
- Disk corruption
- Developer mistakes
- System crashes during writes

## Why This Matters

1. **Irreplaceable Context**: Months of development intelligence lost instantly
2. **Trust Erosion**: Developers won't rely on system that can lose everything
3. **Business Opportunity**: Premium "Weather Station" for guaranteed preservation
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Enterprise-grade reliability

## Weather Station Premium Product Vision

### Free Tier (Local Weather)
```
Local Storage Only
├── Basic weather tracking
├── Local event processing
├── Manual backup responsibility
└── Best effort recovery
```

### Weather Station (Premium)
```
Cloud-Backed Resilience
├── Real-time backup to cloud
├── Point-in-time recovery
├── Cross-device sync
├── Weather history visualization
├── Advanced analytics
├── Team weather sharing
└── Guaranteed preservation
```

## Technical Architecture

### Resilience Layers

1. **Local Redundancy** (Free tier)
```go
type ResilientStorage struct {
    Primary   string // .garden/weather-context.json
    Shadow    string // .garden/.weather-backup.json
    Journal   string // .garden/.weather-journal.log
}
```

2. **Event Sourcing Protection**
```go
// Write-ahead logging for atomic updates
type WeatherJournal struct {
    Entries []JournalEntry
    Applied time.Time
}

// Rebuild from events if context corrupted
func (w *Weather) RebuildFromEvents() error {
    // Scan all events and replay
}
```

3. **Weather Station Sync** (Premium)
```go
type WeatherStation struct {
    LocalWeather  *Weather
    RemoteBackup  BackupService
    SyncInterval  time.Duration
    RetentionDays int
}

func (ws *WeatherStation) ContinuousBackup() {
    // Real-time sync to cloud
    // Encryption at rest
    // Compression
    // Delta updates only
}
```

### Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Corruption Detection**
```go
type HealthCheck struct {
    SchemaValid     bool
    ChecksumMatch   bool
    LastModified    time.Time
    EventCount      int
}
```

2. **Recovery Options**
```bash
# Local recovery
sprout weather recover --from-journal
sprout weather recover --from-events
sprout weather verify --repair

# Weather Station recovery
sprout weather recover --from-station
sprout weather history --point-in-time="2025-05-20"
sprout weather sync --force
```

3. **Backup Strategies**
- Incremental snapshots
- Event replay capability
- Cross-garden correlation preservation
- Conversation history protection

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Local Resilience (Free)
- Shadow copies on every update
- Write-ahead journal
- Atomic file operations
- Basic corruption detection

### Phase 2: Recovery Tools
- Event replay engine
- Context rebuilding
- Verification commands
- Repair utilities

### Phase 3: Weather Station (Premium)
- Cloud backup service
- Real-time sync
- Team sharing
- Advanced analytics
- SLA guarantees

## Business Model

### Weather Station Tiers

**Starter** ($9/month)
- Single developer
- 30-day retention
- Daily backups
- Basic recovery

**Team** ($29/month per garden)
- Unlimited developers
- 90-day retention
- Real-time sync
- Priority support

**Enterprise** (Custom pricing)
- Unlimited gardens
- Unlimited retention
- On-premise option
- SLA guarantees
- Audit logs

## Related Concerns

1. **Privacy**: Encrypted backups, user controls
2. **Compliance**: Data residency options
3. **Performance**: Minimal impact on operations
4. **Bandwidth**: Efficient delta syncing

## Next Steps

- [ ] Design journaling mechanism for free tier
- [ ] Create corruption detection algorithms
- [ ] Architect Weather Station cloud service
- [ ] Define backup format and encryption
- [ ] Plan migration tools for existing users
