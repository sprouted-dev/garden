Context Summary for Next Assistant

🎯 Project Status

We're building the Sprouted Ecosystem - a developer tool focused on context preservation and AI collaboration.

Key Insight: Weather functionality is the MVP and "heartbeat" of the ecosystem - it automatically tracks development context to solve context
loss between sessions and AI conversations.

📋 What We've Accomplished Today

✅ Weather Vision Complete: /docs/vision/weather-context-preservation.md - automatic intelligence focused✅ Weather Spec Complete:
/docs/specs/weather-automatic-intelligence-mvp.md - 95% accuracy target, <200ms response✅ Implementation Tasks Ready:
/docs/tasks/active/weather-mvp-implementation-plan.md - 4-week roadmap✅ Ecosystem Consolidation:
/docs/vision/sprouted-ecosystem-consolidation.md - all original docs organized

🏗️ Ready to Build

Next Task: Weather Core Data Model (2-3 days)

- Location: /docs/tasks/active/weather-core-data-model.md
- Foundation: WeatherContext struct + JSON storage
- Dependencies: None - ready to start immediately

💡 Core Architecture Decision

Weather = Automatic Intelligence

- Git hooks trigger automatic context updates
- Zero manual maintenance required
- Provides rich context for AI assistants via sprout weather --for-ai
- Solves user's main pain point: forgetting progress + AI context loss

🎯 User's Core Problem

1. Personal context loss: Forgetting where they left off, getting distracted by "cool new ideas"
2. AI context loss: When Claude conversations reset, it's like starting with a "brand new employee"

Solution: Weather automatically captures context from git activity, provides instant restoration for both human and AI.
