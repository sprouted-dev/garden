# Weather Emergency Management Agency (WEMA) Specification

## Vision
A holistic system that celebrates rapid development velocity while managing its impact through assessment, recovery, and learning.

## The Tornado Development Cycle

### 1. Pre-Tornado (Velocity Tracking)
Monitor development speed and detect when entering "tornado mode":
- Commits per hour spiking
- Multiple features shipping rapidly
- Documentation lagging implementation
- "Move fast and fix things" mentality

### 2. During Tornado (Active Monitoring)
Real-time tracking while in high-velocity mode:
- What's being built
- What's being broken
- What's being discovered
- What's being deferred

### 3. Post-Tornado (Impact Assessment)
After the storm passes, assess the landscape:
- Run drift detection
- Check seed health
- Identify temporal inconsistencies
- Find documentation gaps
- Catalog technical debt

### 4. Recovery Phase (WEMA Response)
Systematic recovery and improvement:
- Fix critical issues first
- Update documentation
- Reconcile dates/timelines
- Capture lessons learned
- Strengthen the seed

## Integration Architecture

```
sprout weather velocity     â†’ Track speed, compare to enterprise
sprout weather assess       â†’ Run post-tornado assessment
sprout weather recover      â†’ Execute recovery plan
sprout weather lessons      â†’ Document what we learned
```

## WEMA Response Levels

### ðŸŸ¢ Level 1: Light Breeze
- Normal development pace
- Documentation keeping up
- No significant drift

### ðŸŸ¡ Level 2: Strong Winds  
- Increased velocity detected
- Some documentation lag
- Minor drift appearing

### ðŸŸ  Level 3: Tornado Warning
- Extreme velocity (50x+ normal)
- Documentation significantly behind
- Multiple systems changing rapidly

### ðŸ”´ Level 4: Tornado Touchdown
- Maximum velocity achieved
- Major features shipping hourly
- Significant drift inevitable
- WEMA activation recommended

### ðŸŸ£ Level 5: Post-Tornado Recovery
- Velocity returning to normal
- Assessment phase active
- Recovery plan executing

## Automated Responses

When velocity exceeds thresholds:
1. **Auto-snapshot** current state
2. **Flag areas** likely to drift
3. **Create recovery checklist**
4. **Schedule assessment** for when velocity drops

## The Beautiful Destruction

Tornados in development can:
- **Destroy**: Outdated assumptions, slow processes, analysis paralysis
- **Create**: New possibilities, innovative solutions, momentum
- **Reveal**: Hidden problems, better patterns, true velocity

## Recovery Best Practices

1. **Don't Stop the Tornado** - Let creativity flow
2. **Track Everything** - You'll need it later
3. **Assess Honestly** - What broke? What improved?
4. **Fix Strategically** - Critical issues first
5. **Learn Always** - Each tornado teaches

## Success Metrics

- Time from tornado to full recovery
- Drift issues caught automatically
- Lessons documented and applied
- Seed stronger after each cycle
- Velocity celebrated, not feared

## Philosophy

> "Move fast and fix things... but know what needs fixing."

The goal isn't to prevent tornados - they're where innovation happens. The goal is to harness their creative destruction while managing the aftermath professionally.
