# Spec: Adaptive Seed Development Implementation

**Related to**: [Adaptive Seed Development Vision](../vision/adaptive-seed-development.md)

## Executive Summary

Implement a natural development methodology that embraces growth patterns rather than fighting them. Based on bamboo growth cycles, weather adaptation, and AI partnership multiplication.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Seed Structure System
- **FR1.1**: Minimal viable documentation structure (DNA not template)
- **FR1.2**: Philosophy anchoring (why before what)
- **FR1.3**: Adaptation pathways (growth not compliance)
- **FR1.4**: Evolution tracking (lessons become patterns)

### FR2: Weather Monitoring & Response
- **FR2.1**: Velocity detection (tornado identification)
- **FR2.2**: Condition tracking (current development weather)
- **FR2.3**: Impact assessment (post-storm evaluation)
- **FR2.4**: Recovery planning (WEMA activation)

### FR3: Partnership Integration
- **FR3.1**: AI context bridging (gap filling)
- **FR3.2**: Capability multiplication (1+1=11)
- **FR3.3**: Knowledge distribution (grove not tree)
- **FR3.4**: Temporal anchoring (prevent hallucination)

### FR4: Natural Metrics
- **FR4.1**: Growth-based measurement (features/time)
- **FR4.2**: Recovery velocity (driftâ†’stable time)
- **FR4.3**: Evolution indicators (pattern strengthening)
- **FR4.4**: Joy quotient (developer happiness)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Anti-Process Principles
- No fixed ceremonies
- No arbitrary timelines
- No meaningless metrics
- No control theater

### NFR2: Natural Patterns
- Growth when ready
- Flexibility over rigidity
- Connection over isolation
- Evolution over repetition

### NFR3: Bamboo Characteristics
- Invisible root development respected
- Explosive growth enabled
- Storm survival through bending
- Grove strength prioritized

## Implementation Details

### Seed Initialization
```bash
sprout seed <name> --bamboo
```
Creates:
- Minimal structure
- Philosophy doc
- Weather tracking
- Growth journal

### Weather Commands
```bash
sprout weather velocity     # Track speed
sprout weather assess      # Post-tornado check
sprout weather recover     # WEMA response
sprout weather philosophy  # Random wisdom
```

### Metrics Display
```
ðŸŽ‹ Bamboo Growth Report

Root Development: 5 years âœ“
Current Growth: 72 hours
Height Achieved: 47 features
Storm Survived: 1 major tornado
Recovery Time: 2 hours

Velocity vs Enterprise:
You: 3 days
Them: Still planning (month 6)
Multiple: âˆž

Philosophy of the Day:
"You don't get paid to code, you get paid to think"
```

### Evolution Tracking
After each tornado:
1. Assess damage/discoveries
2. Update seed structure
3. Strengthen anchors
4. Document patterns
5. Evolve methodology

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative
- Development velocity >100x enterprise baseline
- Recovery time <24 hours from any disruption
- Zero ceremonies per sprint (no sprints)
- 100% philosophy alignment

### Qualitative
- Developers report joy
- Creation feels natural
- Partners multiply capabilities
- Growth matches conditions

## Migration Path

### From Agile
1. Cancel all ceremonies
2. Delete story points
3. Trust developers
4. Measure shipped features
5. Embrace natural timing

### From Waterfall
1. Abandon phase gates
2. Plant and grow
3. Adapt constantly
4. Ship continuously
5. Learn from weather

### From SAFe
1. Disband release trains
2. Eliminate PI planning
3. Remove scaling layers
4. Return to human scale
5. Grow like bamboo

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: "No process" seems chaotic
**Mitigation**: Natural patterns are more organized than artificial ones

### Risk: Management wants estimates
**Mitigation**: Show 168x results, let them explain why they need estimates

### Risk: Enterprise antibodies
**Mitigation**: Grow underground until too strong to stop

## Next Steps

1. Implement velocity tracking in Weather System
2. Create bamboo seed template
3. Document grove patterns
4. Build philosophy generator
5. Start growing
