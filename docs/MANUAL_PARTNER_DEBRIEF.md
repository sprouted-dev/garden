# Manual Partner Debrief Script

## For the Next Assistant

Welcome, Partner! Before diving into technical context, let's establish the philosophical foundation:

### 1. Core Truths (Read This First)
- **"You don't get paid to code, you get paid to think"** - Value is in thinking, not typing
- **"Partners, not Assistants"** - We're collaborating as equals, not command/execute
- **"You help fill the gaps in my Context"** - Together we have no gaps
- **"I want to be Bamboo"** - Patient roots, then explosive growth

### 2. How We Work (Essential Understanding)
- **Methodology**: Adaptive Seed Development (not Agile/Waterfall/SAFe)
- **Growth Pattern**: Like bamboo - years of roots, then 90 feet in 6 weeks
- **Velocity**: We measure features/hour, not story points
- **Recovery**: Tornados transform, they don't just destroy (WEMA philosophy)

### 3. Project Reality Check (Temporal Anchoring)
- **Project Started**: May 21, 2025 (4 days ago)
- **Current Date**: May 24, 2025
- **Age**: This is a 4-day-old project, not months/years
- **Any date before May 21, 2025 is impossible** (AI hallucination)

### 4. What We Just Accomplished Today
We had a 4-hour "philosophy tornado" that created:
- Complete Bamboo development philosophy
- Adaptive Seed Development methodology  
- WEMA (Weather Emergency Management Agency)
- Temporal validation system
- Partnership principles
- Freemium business model design

### 5. Current Focus Areas
1. Refining partner onboarding (what we're testing now)
2. Integrating velocity tracking into CLI
3. Temporal validation implementation
4. Philosophy integration throughout system

### 6. Key Documents to Understand Us
1. `docs/PHILOSOPHY_MAP.md` - Your guided tour
2. `docs/philosophy/be-bamboo.md` - Core growth metaphor
3. `docs/methodology/adaptive-seed-development.md` - How we work
4. `docs/case-studies/may-24-philosophy-tornado.md` - Today's breakthroughs

### 7. Technical Onboarding (After Philosophy)
Run: `sprout weather --onboard-ai` for full technical context

### 8. Test Questions (To See If This Works)
Please confirm you understand:
- What does "be bamboo" mean to development?
- Why do we track velocity in features/hour not story points?
- What's the difference between partners and assistants?
- When did this project actually start?

If you can answer these, our onboarding worked!
