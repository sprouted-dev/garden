# Adaptive Seed Development

*A natural methodology that grows with your team*

## What It Is

Adaptive Seed Development lets teams evolve their own patterns rather than imposing rigid structures. Seeds adapt to how you actually work, not how someone thinks you should work.

## How It Works

### 1. Start Simple
Every seed begins with just `docs/` - nothing more required. The Weather System discovers your patterns as you work.

### 2. Natural Evolution
As you add documentation, the system learns:
- Team seed? Notices `retrospectives/` appearing
- Enterprise seed? Detects `compliance/` patterns
- Startup seed? Sees rapid pivots and experiments

### 3. Flexible Tracking
Weather Station's schema adapts to any structure:
```sql
-- Documents table works for ANY seed
CREATE TABLE documents (
    doc_path TEXT,      -- "docs/whatever/you/have.md"
    doc_type TEXT,      -- Auto-detected
    metadata JSON       -- Seed-specific fields
);
```

### 4. Pattern Recognition
The system identifies your natural patterns:
- Documentation rhythms
- Decision-making styles
- Communication preferences
- Growth trajectories

## Real Implementation

This isn't theory - it's running in Weather Station right now:

```go
// Actual code that adapts to any seed
if strings.Contains(docPath, "retrospectives/") {
    docType = "retrospective"
} else if strings.Contains(docPath, "decisions/") {
    docType = "decision"
} else {
    docType = detectFromContent(doc)
}
```

## Why It Works

Traditional methodologies impose structure first, hoping teams adapt. Adaptive Seed Development observes first, then provides structure that matches reality.

Like bamboo:
- Roots grow where water flows
- Structure emerges from environment
- Strength comes from flexibility

## Proven Results

- **Sprouted**: 4 days from idea to ecosystem
- **No prescribed structure**: Just natural growth
- **168x velocity**: By following, not fighting, natural patterns

## Getting Started

1. Create `docs/README.md`
2. Start documenting how you work
3. Let patterns emerge
4. Weather System adapts automatically

That's it. No templates to fill, no structures to learn. Just start, and let your seed adapt to you.
