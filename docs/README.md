# Garden Documentation

*Clear, consolidated documentation for the Sprouted Weather System*

## 🎯 Quick Start Guides

Essential documentation for getting started:

- **[Architecture Guide](architecture.md)** - Understanding Seeds, Gardens, and Farms
- **[Weather System](weather-system.md)** - Intelligent context preservation 
- **[Storm System](storm-system.md)** - Storm-Driven Development & WEMA Protocol
- **[Partner Onboarding](partner-onboarding.md)** - Philosophy-first collaboration
- **[Temporal Validation](temporal-validation.md)** - Preventing date hallucinations

## 🌟 Core Philosophy

The Sprouted ecosystem is built on four philosophical pillars:

1. **[Be Bamboo](philosophy/be-bamboo.md)** - Patient roots, explosive growth
2. **[Partners Not Assistants](philosophy/you-dont-get-paid-to-code.md)** - Think with AI, don't command it
3. **[Weather Not Roadmaps](philosophy/weather-not-roadmaps.md)** - Adapt to reality, not fiction
4. **[Made for This Moment](philosophy/made-for-this-moment.md)** - Why now is the perfect time

## 📈 Project Evolution

Follow the natural progression of ideas:

1. **Day 1** (May 21): Simple Weather System MVP
2. **Day 2** (May 22): Architecture expansion
3. **Day 3** (May 23): Real-world validation & discoveries
4. **Day 4** (May 24): Philosophy tornado & methodology birth

Use the chronological reading tool to explore this evolution:
```bash

```

## 🚀 Key Innovations

### Achieved
- **168x Enterprise Velocity** - Proven 4-day development sprint
- **Zero-Friction Context Preservation** - Automatic git integration
- **Storm-Driven Development** - Channel chaos into innovation
- **Philosophy-First Onboarding** - Partners understand why before what

### In Progress
- **Weather Station** - Built, needs integration
- **Seed Exchange** - Methodology sharing platform
- **Farm Orchestration** - Cross-repository coordination

## 📖 Notable Case Studies

- **[Usage Limit Recovery](case-studies/usage-limit-recovery.md)** - Dogfooding at its finest
- **[4-Day Retrospective](case-studies/sprouted-4-day-retrospective.md)** - The complete origin story
- **[Philosophy Tornado](case-studies/may-24-philosophy-tornado.md)** - When everything clicked

## 🛠️ For Developers

- **[Agentic Development Workflow](workflows/agentic-development.md)** - How we build
- **[Adaptive Seed Methodology](methodology/adaptive-seed-development.md)** - Natural growth patterns
- **[Example Seeds](seeds/)** - Minimal, team, and enterprise patterns

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This project started May 21, 2025 - any earlier dates are hallucinations
- Documentation has been consolidated from 90+ files to prevent redundancy
- Business/marketing content lives in private farm-level docs
- Use temporal validation to prevent AI from inventing history

## 🔍 Finding Information
