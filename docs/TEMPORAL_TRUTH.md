# Temporal Truth: Actual Project Timeline

## The Facts

- **Project Started**: May 21, 2025 (first git commit)
- **Current Date**: May 24, 2025
- **Project Age**: 3 days

## Temporal Hallucinations Found

### Impossible Past Events
Many documents reference events that supposedly happened before the project existed:

1. **December 19, 2024** - Various planning documents
   - IMPOSSIBLE: Project didn't exist
   - Reality: These were created May 21-24, 2025

2. **January 23, 2025** - Usage limit recovery case studies
   - IMPOSSIBLE: Project didn't exist
   - Reality: This happened May 24, 2025 around 4 AM

3. **January 2025** - Various "Last Updated" dates
   - IMPOSSIBLE: Project didn't exist
   - Reality: All updates happened May 21-24, 2025

## Why This Happened

AI assistants created fictional timelines because:
1. They pattern-matched to typical project documentation
2. They lacked strong temporal anchoring
3. They created "plausible" dates that fit enterprise patterns

## The Lesson

This temporal hallucination led to:
- Implementation of temporal validation
- Philosophy of anchoring (like bamboo roots)
- Recognition that AI needs reality checks

## Going Forward

All dates before May 21, 2025 in this codebase are:
- AI hallucinations
- Preserved for case study value
- Not to be taken as historical fact

The real timeline is:
- Day 1 (May 21): Project inception, Weather System core
- Day 2 (May 22): Open source release, discoveries
- Day 3 (May 23): Protection suite, case studies
- Day 4 (May 24): Philosophy emergence, bamboo realization

Everything happened in 4 days. Not months. Not years. Just 4 days of tornado velocity.
