## Original Issues
1. Dark mode not working properly after initial Tailwind CSS 4 upgrade
2. Word carousel animation showing blank spaces
3. Component styling broken due to CSS variable usage
4. Wrong green color on buttons (not using brand color)
5. Content not centered properly
6. Navbar buttons not visible on smaller screens
7. Card backgrounds in dark mode had poor contrast
8. Text alignment issues in Weather card

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Fixed PostCSS Configuration
- Updated to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin for Tailwind CSS 4
- Removed old Tailwind configuration files

### 2. Refactored Component Classes
- Converted CSS variable-based components to use Tailwind utilities
- Fixed dark mode by using proper Tailwind dark: modifiers
- Updated brand color to correct #82b366

### 3. Fixed Word Carousel
- Replaced CSS animation approach with JavaScript-based solution
- Used React state and useEffect for smooth transitions
- Each phrase displays for 3 seconds with fade transitions

### 4. Layout Improvements
- Added container classes with responsive padding
- Fixed navbar responsiveness
- Ensured content centering across all sections

### 5. Dark Mode Fixes
- Fixed card backgrounds to use `dark:bg-slate-700` for proper contrast
- Updated text colors to `dark:text-white` for better visibility
- Ensured all sections have proper dark mode support
