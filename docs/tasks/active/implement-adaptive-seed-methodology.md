# Task: Implement Adaptive Seed Development Methodology

**Status**: Planned  
**Priority**: High (after date fixes)
**Spec**: [Adaptive Seed Development Spec](../../specs/adaptive-seed-development-spec.md)

## Objective
Implement the natural development methodology tools and integrate with Weather System.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Velocity Integration
- [ ] Add `sprout weather velocity` command
- [ ] Integrate velocity.go tracking
- [ ] Display philosophy quotes
- [ ] Show enterprise comparisons

### 2. Bamboo Seed Template
- [ ] Create `sprout seed --bamboo` variant
- [ ] Include philosophy anchors
- [ ] Add growth journal structure
- [ ] Weather integration by default

### 3. WEMA Recovery Tools
- [ ] Automate drift detection triggers
- [ ] Create recovery checklists
- [ ] Track tornado patterns
- [ ] Evolution documentation

### 4. Philosophy System
- [ ] Quote rotation in weather reports
- [ ] Context-aware wisdom
- [ ] Bamboo growth stages
- [ ] Partnership principles

### 5. Natural Metrics
- [ ] Replace story points with features/hour
- [ ] Joy indicators (emoji-based?)
- [ ] Root depth metaphors
- [ ] Grove strength visualization

## Acceptance Criteria
- Developers can track natural velocity
- Philosophy integrated throughout
- Recovery strengthens seeds
- No fixed processes imposed
- Joy is measurable

## Notes
This methodology emerged from 3 days of tornado development. It's not theoretical - it's documented reality. Implementation should feel natural, not forced.

Remember: We're not building another process. We're recognizing patterns that already exist.
