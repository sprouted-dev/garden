# Philosophy & Methodology Map for New Partners

Welcome, Partner! This map shows you where to find the soul of this project.

## 🎋 Start Here: Core Philosophy
**Why we work the way we do**

1. **"You Don't Get Paid to Code, You Get Paid to Think"**
   - 📍 `docs/philosophy/you-dont-get-paid-to-code.md`
   - Core truth about value creation
   - Partnership model explained
   - Why AI multiplies rather than replaces

2. **"Be Bamboo"**
   - 📍 `docs/philosophy/be-bamboo.md`
   - Patient roots, explosive growth
   - Why estimates fail (can't see underground)
   - Flexibility beats rigidity

3. **"Made for This Moment"**
   - 📍 `docs/philosophy/made-for-this-moment.md`
   - For those who know what exists but not syntax
   - Why breadth + AI = superpowers
   - From "I can google it" to "my team knows that"

## 🌱 Next: How We Work
**Natural patterns over forced process**

1. **Adaptive Seed Development Overview**
   - 📍 `docs/methodology/adaptive-seed-development.md`
   - Complete methodology explanation
   - Seeds, Weather, and Partners trinity
   - Anti-patterns we reject

2. **Vision: Why Natural Development**
   - 📍 `docs/vision/adaptive-seed-development.md`
   - The paradigm shift from enterprise theater
   - Why current methodologies fight nature

3. **Seeds, Weather, and Partners**
   - 📍 `docs/vision/seeds-weather-and-partners.md`
   - The natural development trinity
   - How each element works

## 🌪️ Then: Velocity & Recovery
**Embracing creative destruction**

1. **Creative Velocity Tracking**
   - 📍 `docs/specs/creative-velocity-tracking.md`
   - Why we measure features/hour not points
   - Enterprise estimates for comedy
   - Celebrating 168x speed

2. **Weather Emergency Management (WEMA)**
   - 📍 `docs/specs/weather-emergency-management-agency.md`
   - Post-tornado assessment
   - Recovery that strengthens
   - Beautiful destruction concept

3. **Velocity as Creative Force**
   - 📍 `docs/vision/velocity-as-creative-force.md`
   - Why speed matters
   - Natural velocity patterns

## 📚 Case Studies: Philosophy in Action
**Real examples of these principles**

1. **AI Temporal Hallucination**
   - 📍 `docs/case-studies/ai-temporal-hallucination.md`
   - When AI created fictional timelines
   - Why anchoring matters

2. **Tornado Assessment**
   - 📍 `docs/case-studies/tornado-assessment-may-24-2025.md`
   - 3-day sprint analysis
   - What we built vs. what broke

3. **Fresh Eyes on AI**
   - 📍 `docs/discoveries/fresh-eyes-on-ai-hallucination.md`
   - Newcomer's perspective value

## 🔧 Finally: Technical Implementation
**Only after understanding philosophy**

1. **Weather System Context**
   - Run: `sprout weather --onboard-ai`
   - Current technical state
   - Active work and progress

2. **Spec-Driven Development**
   - 📍 `docs/workflows/agentic-development.md`
   - How we organize work
   - Vision → Spec → Task flow

## 🚀 Quick Start Path

For new partners, read in this order:
1. **5 min**: "Be Bamboo" philosophy
2. **10 min**: Adaptive Seed Development overview  
3. **15 min**: Current tornado assessment
4. **Then**: Technical onboarding

## 💡 Key Takeaways

Before diving into code, understand:
- You're a partner, not an assistant
- We grow like bamboo (patient roots, explosive growth)
- Natural patterns beat forced process
- Velocity includes recovery
- Philosophy drives everything
